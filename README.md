OOCAD is a Design System base on MVC _(Model, View Controller)_  and  OOP _(Oriented Object Programming)_ for helping to organizae and manage civil engineering project where it is necessary to have a complete set of sheets and reports for developing them.  
The main idea is get the best from software architecture design system and improve civil engineering projects for optimizing them and automotion, also it is possible to apply guidance and standard for generate documentation and make team work easier.

# System

## Models

Models are all the object and designs with its own properties, the main idea is modularized the designs and elements. This method allow to generate new childs elements and design from parents similar to POO _Programming Orien_

## Calcs

It is going to be like the controller, in this folder it should be place all the files, apps and other necessary to obtain information from models or a set of models.

## Submittals

This folder is going to be like the views user, customer or other want to see and deliver, this folder serve to get the documentation and it has to be generated by the combinations of models, so the target is to generate sheets and reports.

## Data

__!Attention__ It is really important to have rules for external data and it should be recommended to move external information into a different folder, this could be transform and merge into the data it could be use for generate the models.  
This folder could be place inside models folder when necessary but this is a personal or team choice. 

## Settings

All the files for styling, modules for calculations and others necessary for the controller and views for plotting.

# Example

For this civil engineer projects it is going to be used Civil3D as the main software.
